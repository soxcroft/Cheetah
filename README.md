# Cheetah
My first semester project for second year CS, which counts the spots that it can see in an image of a cheetah using cellular automata. Implements the instructions in project_spec.pdf. This is a work in progress though. I have also added a class 'GUI.java' which allows the user to visualize all the different images that the project can produce. It needs the command line arguments to be: the file path to the image of the cheetah, epsilon value (for edge detection), minimum spot radius, maximum spot radius.

This project makes use of some of the programs in algs.jar which is used Princeton's Algorithms, 4th edition. The library can be found at: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/

The project instructions were provided by Stelenbosch University.

The cellular automata methods are described in 'Cellular Automata in Image Processing' by Adriana Popovici and Dan Popovici. The article can be found in Popovici.pdf.
